# social-network-api
This is a homework assignment from the UCF Full-Stack Coding Bootcamp. In this project, I am tasked with creating an API for a social networking app using MongoDB, Mongoose and Express.js. The app should allow users to share thoughts, react to friends' thoughts, and create a friend list.
